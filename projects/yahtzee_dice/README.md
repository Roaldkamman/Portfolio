## YahtzeeDice

## This project let's you play Yahtzee without physical dice!


## INFO/ABOUT

I'm using JQuery and bootstrap but most of the CSS styling is done custom.

This project was built from scratch without any coursework or template. 

As always this is a mobile-first responsive design. 

This is the first project where I'm keeping track of my activities and documenting my code correctly using comments. This will be standard practice for me from now on. I have worked the logging and documenting into my project workflow by doing it every time I make 3-5 changes to the project. 

- Site was tested in Chrome for Windows, and FireFox for Windows. 
- HTML validated via the W3C Markup Validation Service.
- CSS validated via the W3C CSS Validation Service.
- JS checked via JS Hint and JS console.

### Desgin Philosophy

I used aspects of the brand to color and design the page. Their theme involves a lot of Green so I chose to color the background that color and use different shades of green for the main color theme. I might include some red later on but whenever I tested that it looked like a Christmas theme. It didn't fit the brand image.

# Activity log: 

* * All activities in order of completion. 


- Created standard files structure using index.html, CSS folder with normalize.css and styles.css, JS folder with main.js and an images folder. 
Added required jpg and svg files. 

- Imported JQuery and Bootstrap. 

- Basic layout and styling of page using mobile-first design. 

- Commenting and documenting CSS properly. 

- Added comments to index.html. 

- Added images of the rules and a scorecard to the images folder to use in a card element later. 

- Slight reediting of footer element in CSS. 

- Added yahtzee instructions and scorecard. Styled them using custom CSS and Bootstrap. 

- Added Bootstrap navigation element.

- Created the dice buttons and visual placeholder aspect. Styled the buttons and layout using custom CSS and Bootstrap. 

- Layout finished for mobile screens. Will edit media queries after the app functionality has been completed. 

- Updated README. 

- Commit to GitHub. 

- Added randomnumber functionality in main.js innerHTML manipulation to generate random numbers onclick events. 

- Removed clear buttons because they were redundant.

- commit to GitHub.
(Side note:) I Think I can make the functionality of the site even simpler by combining the roll 1-5 buttons and showing as many random numbers as clicked in one line. This will be my first objective the next time I work on this project. After that I will resize the app for larger screens. Although I did get a minimum viable product ready here within 48 hours. Also the buttons need better styling. I will add some padding in CSS tomorrow to make them look and feel more appealing. 

- As mentioned previously in a note I edited the HTML and JavaScript so that now there are 5 buttons that generate the right amount of generated numbers depending on the button clicked. The base state of the site there are 5 0's as placeholders for the generated numbers. 

- Documented the JavaScript using comments.

- Imported font from google.

- Adjusted mobile-first CSS text font-sizes for new font. 

- Edited and optimized CSS for buttons. 

### Summary so far: Site is half the size with the same amount of functionality. Site is more accassible, and has fully optimized CSS for mobile design. 

## comment

Before adding in larger breakpoints and optimizing the site for larger screens I want to try and add in extra functionality using JavaScript. I'm thinking of an input field that remembers the generated numbers you clicked on. So that when a player rolls 5 dices he can keep 2 by clicking on the numbers and they would be added to the input field so they are easy to remember. 

- Commit to Github. 

- Fixed the id attribute of the #dice ID so that the navigation points to the correct section of the website. 

- Commit to GitHub. Time for break. 

- Tried building the new functionality interactive notepad but ran into an issue. Asked a more experienced friend for help. Here is a link to a video containing a detailed description of the issue: https://www.loom.com/share/c8171d2516cb4620a9d616ce31b6eed1

- Commit to GitHub since nothing has functionally changed in the app for a user. There is unfinished JS work in progress. 

- Found the solution to the problem mentioned above. Source: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60607808/textcontent-not-working-on-generated-html

- Made sure the function works for every element necessary. Will add input textfield and functionality in tomorrow. 

- Commit to GitHub.

- Added input field and styling for new functionality explained above. 

- Started working on JavaScript for the new functionality but ran into a wall. Went to stack overflow for help: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60621111/cant-figure-out-how-to-grab-value-of-button-click-event-and-paste-it-into-a-tex

- first commit will check back on project soon.

- Found solution to problem with help and implemented new functionality in JavaScript. 

- Added a clear input button that clears the input field when clicked. Styled in CSS and coded in JavaScript. (finally found a place to implement red brand colors)

### Notes:
 I feel like there is more I can do with this project and I may revisit it on a later date. Perhaps I can create an if statement to check if the numbers in the text input field match a Yahtzee combination. And if it does flash the combination on the screen or add it to a custom scorecard form on the page. I could generate a certain amount of forms depending on user input on the page. Essentially at that point I would be working on creating the full Yahtzee game in the browser. That will be Phase 3 of the project. Phase 2 would be adding combination reckognition logic and responding to combinations. Phase 3 would also take a lot of time and iterations. For now I will just make sure that the website is optimized for all platforms and screen sizes before taking a break on this project. 

- commit to GitHub with new functionalities. 

- edited position of instructions on page for UX purposes. 

- Tried adjusting the CSS so that the two cards on the page would display next to each other. I have tried every method I know so far and nothing works. I have not tried floats yet but I prefer to stay away from that method. I think BootStrap is getting in the way of this working. Will have to figure out how to do it. Other than that I would change the font-size properties on different breakpoints and maybe increase the size of the buttons on larger displays. Fairly easy stuff. As soon as I have a solution to the cards display I will edit that and the project will be finished for now.
