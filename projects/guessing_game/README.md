# Project 7 JavaScript Game Show app. 

## This project let's you play a phrase guessing game!


## INFO/ABOUT

The main component to making this project successful will be JavaScript. In this project I chose to minimally use Jquery and practice mostly plain JavaScript to challenge myself.

Full disclosure: A CSS template was provided but I will still provide some custom CSS. 

This is an exception to the mobile-first design rule that I prefer to apply to myself. The CSS template provided by my study partners from TeamTreeHouse TechDegree is NOT mobile-first and will break on smallers screens.

- Site was tested in Chrome for Windows, and FireFox for Windows. 
- HTML validated via the W3C Markup Validation Service.
- CSS validated via the W3C CSS Validation Service.
- JS checked via JS Hint and JS console.

I will document my progress, tasks completed and problem solving when I run into them. I will also leave notes where applicable.

# Activity log: 

* * All activities in order of completion. 

- created global variables.

- created a CSS class and styling for a transition that would hide the starting overlay.

- added an event listener with a click handler to the start button with a function that adds the .hide class to the overlay element when the button is clicked creating a nice user experience.     

- created an array to hold all the phrases you can guess, and added the phrases into the array. 

- documented JavaScript and CSS changes using comments. 

- GitHub Commit. 

- created function that takes any array, grabs a random item from the array and splits the characters of that array into a new array and returns it. 

- created function that takes the random phrase selected and displays it in the DOM. 

- tested functionality so far. Didn't run into any errors.

- created checkLetter function that checks the letter clicked against the phrase to see if it appears. 

- created event listener that on keyboard click passes the clicked button to the checkLetter function. 

- overlay was bugged and had to re-do the hide functionality. ID was overwriting .hide class. Had to remove transition. (note to add transition in later)
