        <h3>About this Project</h3>
        <p>I created this Portfolio by examining many different portfolio's from my peers and combined some of the strongest elements I could find.</p>
        <h3>Design Philosophy:</h3>
        <p>With this capstone portfolio I wanted to try out dark mode design. Something I have personally fallen in love with recently. I also aimed to create my most interactive site yet using some more advanced CSS overlays and a parallax effect.</p>
